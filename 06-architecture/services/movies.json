A camera installed on the roof of the Exploratorium museum in San Francisco captured an image of the sky every 10 secobnds. From these images, I created a mosaic of time-lapse movies, each showing a single day. The days are arranged in chronological order. My intent was to reveal the patterns of light and weather over the course of a year."},

I ended up filming for 18 hours until the Park was reopened at 6pm on November 15, 2011. The police presence was overwhelming, more than I've ever seen - more than during the blackout, more than the days after September 11th."},

We used some very interesting and unique sound tools when creating this piece. The result is very detailed, subtle and reserved."}
